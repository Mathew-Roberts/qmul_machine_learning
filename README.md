Advanced Machine Learning techniques learnt during masters degree

Courseworks 1 + 2 : Graph based classification, using the incidence matrix and the corresponding graph laplacian to perform supervised and unsupervised learning. For supervised learning - we discerned whether a character appears in the DC or Marvel universe through their graph connections and weights. For the unsupervised learning task, we created our own graph from the 'make_moons' dataset from SK-learn and classified the data without prior knowledge of any labels. This was done through analysing the eigen vectors of the graph laplacian

Coursework 4: Writing a k means clustering algorithm from scratch, to classify the 'old faithful geyser' dataset. This is an example of unsupervised learning

Coursework 6: Sparse Principal Component Analysis and Singular Value Decomposition examples !

Coursework 7: Robust Principal Component Analysis - introducing Nesterov accelerated gradient descent

Coursework 8: Building a recommendation system through matrix completion. We predicted the ratings (filled in empty null values for films that users hadn't watched) for 1682 movies and 943 users.

Coursework 9: Exploring Dual Numbers and Automatic Differentiation. Used pytorch to create neural network based autoencoders for the coding and decoding of the Fashion MNIST dataset
